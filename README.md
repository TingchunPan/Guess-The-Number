# Guess-The-Number
This game is the project for Day12 in 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 by Dr. Angela Yu.

It can allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
The program will check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
If it got the answer correct, the screen will show the actual answer to the player.

Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).
You can directly play on:
